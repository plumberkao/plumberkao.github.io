<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow, happens. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
