<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be checked yearly. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated each year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your home.
