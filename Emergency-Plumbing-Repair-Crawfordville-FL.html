<p>This ion exchange process is assisted in by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another combination that can work on sink obstructions. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mixture sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the very first time, you can repeat this procedure. We do warm water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>

A clogged drain can even lead to slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and expensive repairs.</p>
