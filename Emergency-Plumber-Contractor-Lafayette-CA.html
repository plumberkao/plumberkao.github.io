<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regrow after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
