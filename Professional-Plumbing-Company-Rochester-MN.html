Newer units utilize digital sensors that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and therefore just regrow when needed. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
