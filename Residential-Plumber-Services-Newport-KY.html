Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way might have conserved her a lot of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you water with safe and clean water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are also required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
