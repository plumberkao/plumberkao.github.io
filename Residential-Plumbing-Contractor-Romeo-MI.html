<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
