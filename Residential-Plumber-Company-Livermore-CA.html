I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
