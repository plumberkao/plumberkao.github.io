<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on.
