<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
