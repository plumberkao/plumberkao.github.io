<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
