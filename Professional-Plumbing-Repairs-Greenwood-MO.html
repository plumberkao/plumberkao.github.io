<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Because I love to prepare, I create a great deal of meals. We set up a short-lived workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we required the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the home within thirty minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it obstructs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely pleased that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly utilize this company again and again in the future.</p>
