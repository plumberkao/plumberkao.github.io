<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never precisely matches supply.
