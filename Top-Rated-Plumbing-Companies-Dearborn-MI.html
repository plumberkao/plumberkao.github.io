Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water hardness can be removed relatively easily by using an ion exchange procedure. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations describe favorably charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the firmness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style).

This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
