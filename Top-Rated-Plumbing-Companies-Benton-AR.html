<p>This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for several years to come. Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health danger if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be indicated on building strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
<p>A couple of local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any area where it may ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not allow the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't allow the usage of a PVB at all, so contact your water supplier. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out of under the cap when backflow takes place, so it must be set up in an area where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
