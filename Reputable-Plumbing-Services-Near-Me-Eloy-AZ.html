<p>Salt consumption from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or ecological factors necessitate restricting sodium, substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride may be proper. Gradually, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has 3 cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regrowth process can be arranged instantly with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
