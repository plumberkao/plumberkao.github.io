<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly regenerated. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to lower these signs.</p>
