<p>Really frequently the circular blade within is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Merely place a long, durable, wooden deal with (a broom manage will suffice) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force pushing down, turn clockwise till you feel it turn easily. It may be needed to reset the disposal.
