<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
