<p>During normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the exterior.

For this reason, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and enable sufficient drainage.</p>
