Many obstructions are triggered by putting excessive toilet paper into the bowl. Know how much toilet paper your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever place any paper item into the toilet bowl other than toilet paper. Paper towels can rapidly block the toilet drain line or trigger a clog even more down the drain. Feminine health products need to be disposed of in the trash and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>Cooking oil and other greases must never ever be put down the garbage disposal due to the fact that they can restrain the blades. Lastly, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to guarantee that all food particles have been washed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from entering the garbage disposal, so you're only sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
