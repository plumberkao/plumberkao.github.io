There are 2 main systems; tank and tankless electric heating systems when it comes to electrical water heaters.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect over time, they gradually begin to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
