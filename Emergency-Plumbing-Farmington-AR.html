<p>As water heaters age, particularly when they approach the years mark, you might begin to notice some problems. Any kinds of odd sounds normally suggest trouble. Popping sounds, for instance, indicate that the water is boiling (which must never ever occur). Sediment build-up or a faulty thermostat represent common factors for boiling water.

<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in many locations have actually significantly decreased the number of reported occurrences that take place within our water supply. This has at times resulted in individuals thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever actually have actually been a concern in the very first location.
