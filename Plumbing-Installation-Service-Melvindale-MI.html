<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
