Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to leave. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
