<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
