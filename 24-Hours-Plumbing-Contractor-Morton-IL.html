<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
