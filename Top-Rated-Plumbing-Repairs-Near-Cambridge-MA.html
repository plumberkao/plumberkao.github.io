<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Cambridge MA</h3>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are typically equivalent, though replacement usually will not require added fees, such as application fees. New meters must fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas companies may need an unique meter for their services, limiting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the building license. Inspections must be made after structure excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon conclusion. NOTE: If defective work is found, the inspector will provide an offense notification, and a specific time period is allotted to remedy the problem.</p>
