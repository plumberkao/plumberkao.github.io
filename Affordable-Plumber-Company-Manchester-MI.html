In the ON position, the disposal runs at a constant speed which allows you to grind food waste as quick as you can work. Rinckey said that a conservative price quote of 20 to 30 percent is how much longer an appliance's life-span is with the addition of a water softening system. He added that a base system purchased through him costs around $1,100. The service call and installation of my new water heater cost $1,300. The mathematics describes all of it.</p>
