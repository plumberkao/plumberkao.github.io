A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hampering water flow. By installing a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other discarding areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
