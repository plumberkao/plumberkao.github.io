<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Barnesville GA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
