<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is provided for purposes of removing bacterial concerns and making the water drinkable. These are certainly priorities for a town and its residents however difficult water can negatively impact faucets and appliances in a home. With the high calcium content of local water, it can trigger a dishwasher or hot water heater to malfunction. If the concern is repeating or the damage is comprehensive, you may be much better off repiping. For small leaks and one-off problems, repairing the pipe is generally enough.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 on average depending on the length from the main gas line. Setting up a natural gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the backyard costs $300 to $1,400.
