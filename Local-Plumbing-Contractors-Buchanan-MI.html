<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the approach set out above. Since the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested each year to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your home.
