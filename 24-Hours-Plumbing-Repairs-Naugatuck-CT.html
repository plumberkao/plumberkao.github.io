<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
