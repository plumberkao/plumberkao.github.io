<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin has already been fouled. Once again, it is a good idea to examine the manufacturer's guidelines for unique preventative measures.</p>
<p>As difficult water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" salt ions are launched into the water. Softer clothing without hard minerals caught in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites remain whiter without the run down gray brought on by difficult water.
