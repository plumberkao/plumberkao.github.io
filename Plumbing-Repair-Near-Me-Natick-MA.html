Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
