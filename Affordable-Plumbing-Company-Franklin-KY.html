The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
