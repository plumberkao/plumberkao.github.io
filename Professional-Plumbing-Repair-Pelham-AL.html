<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen.
