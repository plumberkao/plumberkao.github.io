The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.</p>
<p>Changing the ring that seals the connection between the sewer and the bowl line means entirely eliminating the entire toilet. So it's a. good time to think about getting a brand name brand-new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
