Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl).

Garbage disposal service warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can vary in between 2 and ten years.
