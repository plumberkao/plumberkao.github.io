<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to organisation? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water really needs it. Newer systems use electronic sensors that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other key metrics based upon your water use and therefore only regenerate when required. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
