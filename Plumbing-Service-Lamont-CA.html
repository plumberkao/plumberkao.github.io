<p>An Innovative solution making it possible for Energies to proactively monitor their water networks, trace leaks and pinpoint their specific areas while using highly sensitive acoustic sensing units, management software & mobile applications. Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in hard water The resulting soft water needs less soap for the very same cleaning effort, as soap is not squandered bonding with calcium ions. Soft water also extends the life time of plumbing by reducing or removing scale build-up in fittings and pipes. Water softening is generally achieved using lime softening or ion-exchange resins but is significantly being achieved utilizing nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from liquified sodium chloride salt, likewise called brine. In the ion exchange procedure, salt ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble wet sand. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to prospective contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>

When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
