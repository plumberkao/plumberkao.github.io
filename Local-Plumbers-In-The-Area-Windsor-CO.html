Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>
