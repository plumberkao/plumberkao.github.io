However that does not suggest toilets are best-- over time they will need to be fixed when something goes wrong, and they might even eventually need to be replaced. Whether you're aiming to install a new toilet or fix up the one you have so it works fresh once again, you can depend upon the Sterling plumbers from Donmar Heating, Cooling & Plumbing to finish the job.</p>
