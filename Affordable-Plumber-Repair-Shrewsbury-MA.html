Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
