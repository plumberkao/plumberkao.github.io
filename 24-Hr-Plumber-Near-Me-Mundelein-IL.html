Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
