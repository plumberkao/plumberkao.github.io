<p>This type of valve is utilized on agricultural locations. It is indicated to keep the local water supply clean in the existence of numerous farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. The use of these items is called chemigation. There are a number of parts to this valve. The check valve has a spring operated flapper, which allows circulation in only one direction.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily stored for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
