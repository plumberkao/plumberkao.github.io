A garbage disposal can decrease a home's general garbage output by pulverizing most typical food scraps so they can be eliminated through the sink as wastewater. A garbage disposal fits practically seamlessly into the sink, and can be kept by merely disposing of a few ice cubes and some baking soda once a month to hone the blades and reduce unpleasant odors.</p>
