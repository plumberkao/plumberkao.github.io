The previous decade has brought a host of new, more diverse options for improving your hot water heater's energy performance and reducing your energy bills. Whereas warm water heaters used to come in either tank or tankless choices, there are now much more alternatives for improving water heating energy intake. Tankless Hot Water Heater - If you are tight on space, or if you are interested in cutting down on energy expenses when heating water for use throughout your home, then you might wish to think about the installation of a tankless water heater.
