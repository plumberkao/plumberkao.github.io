<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the 3 available methods. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure involves covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leakages and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the inside of the pipe and the material flowing through it. This repair method is better for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals. The technician, Kenny, was polite, professional and helpful! He asked me to look at the camera with him then explained my alternatives without attempting to oversell me!

When the tank rusts through, there is no way to repair it; replacement is the only solution. Turn the garbage disposal over and get rid of electrical cover plate. Take out wires. Insert cable television connector (not included) and run electrical cable through access hole on bottom of garbage disposal. Tighten up cable television connector. Press wires into waste disposal unit (do not displace cardboard shield) and replace electrical cover plate.</p>
<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative supplies much better, more secure drinking water.
