There are two main kinds of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most typically used in commercial facilities.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance.

That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
