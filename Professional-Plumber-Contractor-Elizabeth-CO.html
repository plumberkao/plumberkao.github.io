If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house.

If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Check the directions if your valve is a various style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
