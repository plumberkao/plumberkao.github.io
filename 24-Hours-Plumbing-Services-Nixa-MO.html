There are two main sort of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and decreased pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most typically utilized in commercial facilities.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
