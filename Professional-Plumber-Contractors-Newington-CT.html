<p>City water mains supply water for many structures and houses, including the water used in fire defense systems. But the stagnant water that fills the pipes of damp fire protection systems is non-potable"-- it's not fit to consume. Thus, water authorities frequently require property owners to install backflow preventers to keep stagnant water from mixing with the dealt with, safe and clean" water in the city supply of water.

It might not be installed in any area where it may ever be submerged under water. Some municipalities do not permit the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some do not enable the usage of a PVB at all, so talk to your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out of under the cap when backflow happens, so it needs to be installed in an area where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>

Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally salt. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
