For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and split or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly advise likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
