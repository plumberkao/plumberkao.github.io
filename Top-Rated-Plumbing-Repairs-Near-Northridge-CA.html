<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
