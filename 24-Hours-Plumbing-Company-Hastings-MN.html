There are two basic kinds of toilet flushing systems; both types conserve water by utilizing 1.6 gallons of water per flush. Gravity-fed flush toilets utilize the force of gravity and a siphon "pull-through" action to empty the bowl. Look for gravity-fed toilets providing high performance to efficiently and quietly dispose waste.</p>
