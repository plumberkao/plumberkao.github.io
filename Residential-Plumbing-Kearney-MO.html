<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
<p>Gas lines can be harmful, and it's always best to deal with any problems with the assistance of a professional. House owners must never ever try to fix a gas line on their own.
