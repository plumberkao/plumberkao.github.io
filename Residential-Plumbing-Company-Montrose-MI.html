<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Montrose MI</h3>
<p>Horseshoe Bay homes and organisations may have several locations needing backflow preventers. Our most typical applications in Horseshoe Bay are noted here. The system selected for a given installation should be proper for the system style and site conditions, consisting of consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to occur. Further, it must be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, producer specifications, and engineering standards for the kind of unit to be utilized.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked each year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked yearly to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house. For additional information or help please call the Cross Connection Control office at 301-206-4004.</p>
